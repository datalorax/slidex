Title: Convert Microsoft PowerPoint Slides to R Markdown
Description: This package is designed to extract information from Microsoft 
    PowerPoint slides, and then put that information into an R Markdown document 
    with a {xaringan} <https://github.com/yihui/xaringan> YAML. If the 
    xaringan package is also installed, beautiful html slides can then be 
    produced by knitting the RMD. At present, the package exports one function,
    `convert_pptx`, which converts a .pptx file to R Markdown. The package is
    not intended to be all encompassing or provide perfect conversion. Rather, 
    it should get you about 90% of the way there for about 80% of use cases. 
    Given the idiosyncrasies of different slide show presentations, it is 
    expected that some manual editing of the resulting RMD will need to be 
    completed to get the HTML slides to look exactly as you want them, but most 
    of the hard work should be done for you. Importantly, the package maintains 
    and provides the proper code for any images that were embedded in the .pptx 
    slides, as well as links. Tables are also generally maintained, although 
    they may require some manual editing if complex spanner heads and merged 
    cells were used in the original table. Nested bulleted lists should also be 
    maintained.
