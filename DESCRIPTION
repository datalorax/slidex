Title: Converts Microsoft PowerPoint Slides to R Markdown
Description: This package is designed to extract information from Microsoft 
  PowerPoint slides, and then put that information into an R Markdown document 
  with a {xaringan} <https://github.com/yihui/xaringan> YAML. If the 
  xaringan package is also installed, beautiful html slides can then be
  produced by knitting the RMD. At present, the package exports one function,
  `convert_pptx`, which converts a .pptx file to R Markdown. The package is
  not intended to be all encompassing or provide perfect conversion. Rather, it should get you about 90% of the way there for about 80% of use
  cases. Given the idiosyncrasies of different slide show presentations, it
  is expected that some manual editing of the resulting RMD will need to be 
  completed to get the HTML slides to look "perfect", but most of the hard work
  should be done for you. Importantly, the package maintains and provides the 
  proper code for any images that were embedded in the PPTX slides, as well as
  links. Tables are also generally maintained, although they may require some
  manual editing if complex spanner heads and merged cells were used in the 
  original table. Nested bulleted lists should also be maintained.
