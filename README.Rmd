# slidex

This package is a work-in-progress, but is aimed at making the process of 
converting Microsoft PowerPoint slides to beautiful HTML
[xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) slides as seamless as possible,
maintaining tables, figures, links, and bulleted lists.

## Installation
The package is not yet on CRAN. Install the development version with

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("datalorax/slidex")
```

## Basic usage
At present, the package exports a single function, `convert_pptx`, which takes two required arguments: the `path` to the PPTX file (passed as a string), and the `author` (also passed as a string). For example:

```{r example1, eval = FALSE}
library(slidex)
pptx <- system.file("examples", "slidedemo.pptx", package = "slidex")

convert_pptx(path = pptx, author = "Daniel Anderson")
```

You can optionally pass additional arguments, such as `theme` (see a list of themes [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources)) or a new `title`.

## Suggested packages
Although not a dependency, the package functionally requires the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package, and works best if the [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr), [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra), and [tibble](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble) packages are installed. Without the latter three, tables will not be produced, although the code to create a dataframe from the tables will still be embedded. Install suggested packages from CRAN with

```{r install-suggested, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("xaringan", "knitr", "kableExtra", "tibble"))
```

## Things the package **should** be able to do
* Maintain bulleting levels
* Maintain bolding and italicizing (no support for underlining yet)
* Maintain pictures
* Maintain links (slightly imperfect currently)
* Extract notes from the slides. By default the notes are embedded in the slides
and a separate .txt file is written out.

## Things the package does not yet do, but hopefully will
* Pull data and potentially reproduce plots (some support for this already, look in "assets/data" if you have a chart and want the data from it)
* Convert `emf` file types to `png`s. This is a Microsoft proprietary format and will require users have LibreOffice installed.
* Maintain two-panel layouts
* Support both .ppt and .pptx file types. Currently only the latter is supported. Will require LibreOffice.

## Other ideas?
I'd love to hear from you if you've used the package and had success or you've struggled. Either way, feedback, particularly at this early stage, would be greatly appreciated.
